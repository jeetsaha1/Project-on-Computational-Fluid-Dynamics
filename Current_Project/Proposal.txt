Title :  An Overview of Mixed Convection Flow in a Backward-Facing Step Channel: A Numerical Approach

Abstract


This project involves a numerical study of steady laminar mixed convection flow and heat transfer in 
a backward-facing step channel using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The governing continuity, momentum,
 and energy equations are solved using the finite volume method with a pressure correction algorithm developed 
 in Fortran. A structured Cartesian grid is used to model the stepped channel geometry, and appropriate boundary 
 conditions are applied at the inlet, outlet, and channel walls.


The effect of buoyancy is included through the Richardson number to account for mixed convection, while thermal
 diffusion is represented by the Prandtl number. Velocity, pressure, and temperature distributions are obtained
  after achieving convergence based on residual criteria. Entropy generation due to heat transfer and fluid friction 
  is also evaluated to understand thermodynamic losses in the flow. The results are visualized using Techplot to 
  analyze flow separation, recirculation zones, temperature distribution, and entropy behavior downstream of the 
  step. This project helps in understanding mixed convection characteristics in channels with geometric discontinuities
   and demonstrates the practical application of CFD techniques.

OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSAL

Mixed convection flow in channels with geometric discontinuities such as backward-facing steps exhibits complex 
interactions between forced flow, buoyancy effects, heat transfer, and flow separation. Understanding these interactions
is important for the design and optimization of thermal systems such as heat exchangers, cooling passages, and industrial 
flow channels. The present project aims to develop a reliable numerical framework to study these phenomena in detail using
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).



Based on the background and scope of the present work, the objectives of this project are outlined as follows:

To perform a detailed numerical investigation of steady, laminar mixed convection flow and heat transfer in a backward-facing 
step channel, capturing the coupled effects of fluid flow and thermal transport using a CFD-based approach.

To solve the governing continuity, momentum, and energy equations using the finite volume method combined with a pressure 
correction algorithm, implemented in a fixed-form Fortran code, and to ensure numerical stability and accuracy of the solution.

To examine the influence of buoyancy forces on the flow and thermal fields by incorporating the Richardson number, and to study
 its effect on velocity distribution, pressure field, temperature contours, and overall flow structure.

To analyze the flow separation, recirculation zones, and reattachment length downstream of the backward-facing step, and to 
understand how geometric discontinuity alters the hydrodynamic behavior of mixed convection flows.

To investigate heat transfer characteristics within the stepped channel, including temperature distribution and thermal 
stratification, for different mixed convection conditions governed by the Prandtl number.

To evaluate entropy generation due to heat transfer and fluid friction, with the objective of quantifying thermodynamic 
irreversibility and identifying regions of high energy loss within the flow domain.

To visualize and interpret the numerical results using Techplot, enabling clear representation of flow patterns, thermal 
behavior, recirculation regions, and entropy generation mechanisms.

To establish the developed numerical solver as a reliable computational tool for studying mixed convection and thermodynamic 
performance in channels with geometric discontinuities.
