Title : Numerical Investigation of Mixed Convection Flow and Heat Transfer in a Backward-Facing Step Channel

Abstract

Mixed convection flow in channels with geometric discontinuities such as backward-facing steps is of significant 
interest due to its wide applications in heat exchangers, cooling systems, and industrial flows. In this work, 
a numerical investigation of laminar mixed convection flow and heat transfer in a backward-facing step channel 
is performed. The governing continuity, momentum, and energy equations are solved using a finite volume–based 
pressure correction approach implemented in a Fortran code. A structured Cartesian grid is employed to discretize
the computational domain, and appropriate boundary conditions are applied at the inlet, outlet, and solid walls.
The effect of buoyancy is incorporated through the Richardson number, while thermal diffusion is governed by the 
Prandtl number. Velocity, pressure, and temperature fields are obtained after achieving convergence based on 
prescribed residual criteria. The numerical results are post-processed and visualized using Techplot to analyze 
flow separation, reattachment, and thermal behavior downstream of the step. The study captures key flow features 
such as recirculation zones and temperature stratification induced by mixed convection. The developed solver 
demonstrates stable convergence and physically consistent results. This work provides a reliable numerical framework
for studying mixed convection flows in complex channel geometries.
